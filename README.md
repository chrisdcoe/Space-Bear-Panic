# Space-Bear-Panic
The Space Station has been infested by an alien hive-mind life-form known only as The Entity. You need to escape, but your shuttle is out of power!

Space Bear Panic was created in Stencyl. It was initially created over a 72 hour period for Ludum Dare, a game development jam.

Updates continued over the next few months.
